At BU,  we use Moodle quizzes to grade lab assignments. This allows us a simple way for students to get credit for tasks such as demonstrating a circuit or explaining a concept to course staff.
It could easily be used for a proctor check-off during a test; for example, to indicate that a proctor has verified a student's identity.

To install Moodle 2.1+ using git, execute the following commands in the root of your Moodle install:

    git clone git://github.com/ktemkin/moodle-qtype_checkoff.git question/type/checkoff
    echo '/question/type/checkoff' >> .git/info/exclude

Or, extract the following zip in your_moodle_root/question/type/:
